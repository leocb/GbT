HOW TO MAKE AN EXTRA CLASS!!!!
--------------------------------------------------------

You can make extra classes here. Set everything up here and the rest will be done for you! no more editing 100 files without knowing what you're doing!!!
Ok here's how:

To make an extra class do this:
AddExtraTeam( "<NAME OF THE CLASS>", Color(<red>, <Green>, <blue>, 255), "<Player model>" , [[<the description(it can have enters)>]], { "<first extra weapon>","<second extra weapon>", etc...}, "<chat command to become it(WITHOUT THE /!)>", <maximum amount of this team> <the salary he gets>, 0/1/2 = public /admin only / superadmin only, <1/0/true/false Do you have to vote to become it>, TEAM: Which team you need to be to become this team)

The real example is here: it's the Hobo:		*/

--VAR without /!!!			The name    the color(what you see in tab)                   the player model					The description
TEAM_HOBO = AddExtraTeam("Hobo", Color(80, 45, 0, 255), "models/player/corpse1.mdl", [[The lowest member of society. All people see you laugh. 
You have no home.
Beg for your food and money
Sing for everyone who passes to get money
Make your own wooden home somewhere in a corner or 
outside someone else's door]], {"weapon_bugbait"}, "hobo", 5, 0, 0, false)
//No extra weapons           say /hobo to become hobo  Maximum hobo's = 5		his salary = 0 because hobo's don't earn money.          0 = everyone can become hobo ,      false = you don't have to vote to become hobo
// MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO / IN THE TEAM NAME OR IN THE TEAM COMMAND:
// TEAM_/DUDE IS WROOOOOONG !!!!!!
// HAVING "/dude" IN THE COMMAND FIELD IS WROOOOOOOONG!!!!
//ADD TEAMS UNDER THIS LINE:
